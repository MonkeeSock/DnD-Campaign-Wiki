Dragis Balor is a group in [[Vokmir]] which has resisted the dragon [[Caldor]] and the formation of [[Caldoria]]. While the majority of fighters in the organization are [[Dragonborn]], many other species have joined its ranks including many [[Gnomes]]. 

Most recently, Dragis Balor suffered a crushing defeat against Caldor's forces. Many resistance fighters and those under their protection have been forced to flee to surrounding regions, primarily through [[Kelwar's Gap]], into [[Nemna]].
