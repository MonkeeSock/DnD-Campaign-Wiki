While not necessarily the largest plane, the Material Plane is by far the most diverse plane of existence and contains the most mortal souls. Once, all things were contained on the Material Plane but during [[The War of the Gods]] the various planes were split into their current, distinct forms. The Material Plane sits at the nexus of all other planes and it is possible to travel to the other planes from it at the places where these planes still overlap. 

There are several continents on the Material Plane, the most documented ones being: [[Cyn-Tollir|/Material Plane/Cyn-Tollir]] and [[Illaset]]. [[Drazkuvar]] was continent on the plane but was destroyed during [[The War of the Gods]].
