Kelwar's Gap is a break in the mountain range which forms the border between [[Sulwaf]] and [[Vokmir]]. Since [[Dragis Balor]] suffered a crushing defeat against [[Caldor]]'s forces members of the organization and other refugees have fled through the gap. This led to a brief period known as the Kelwar's Gap Disaster. As refugees fled through the gap they were held up at the border into [[Nemna]] as the army of [[Caldoria]] attacked from [[Vokmir]]. Eventually, members of [[Dragis Balor]] were able to repel the [[Caldoria]]n army and [[Nemna]] began to allow refugees in.
