Caldoria is a kingdom in the region of [[Vokmir]] on [[Cyn-Tollir]]. It was founded by and named after the black Dragon [[Caldor]]. The kingdom dominates the entirety of the region and under Caldor's reign has been steadily eliminating or removing metallic [[Dragonborn]] from the population. While other chromatic dragonborn are not as favored as black dragonborn are, they are generally allowed to stay and hold power there if they swear fealty to Caldor. 

There has been significant resistance to the dragon both inside and out of Caldoria. The pirate [[Rue Sheerwater]] has often assaulted the coast while being based out of [[Wynion]]. Within Caldoria the primary group resisting the dragon is [[Dragis Balor]].
