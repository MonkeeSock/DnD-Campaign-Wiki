Caldoria is a kingdom in the region of [[Vokmir]] on [[Cyn-Tollir]]. It was founded by and named after the black Dragon [[Caldor]]. The kingdom dominates the entirety of the region and under Caldor's reign has been steadily eliminating or removing metallic dragonborn from the population. While other chromatic dragonborn are not as favored as black dragonborn are, they are generally allowed to stay and hold power there if they swear fealty to Caldor.
