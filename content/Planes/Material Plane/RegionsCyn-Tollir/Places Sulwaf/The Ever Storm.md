Just off the coast on [[Nemna]], near the Cape of Iartome (See [[Emperor Iartome]]) there is an area of sea where storm clouds are always brewing, forming a swirling gyre of darkness and malice. Ferocious storms often break out across this area, sinking any ships foolish enough to attempt to cross it.
