Ithamon Tower is a wizard's tower in [[Iartomita]], on the the cliffs of the Ithamon peninsula which cling to the mainland as they are battered by the waves. It is he tallest building in the city and rises imposingly over the surrounding buildings. The tower was built by elves and long before the rest of the city. It has actually retained its sovereignty as the city was built around it. Neither [[Nemna]] or [[The Old Empire]] have been able to challenge the combined might of the towers ingrained defenses and its occupant combines. 

Because the tower's independence citizens of Nemna and the peninsula in particular have often petitioned to the wizard for many issues, including protection. It is rare that these requests are granted. 

The current [[Wizard of Ithamon]] is [[Calum Quaide Kincaid]]. He is generally reclusive and stays out of the city's and kingdom's affairs, avoiding conflict. His arcane services can be hired for quite a price. Some years ago the temple of [[Lifttan]] sent an armed force to retrieve proscribed knowledge from the tower and its former wizard and suffered a crushing defeat. 

There have been many Wizards of Ithamon, each passing the title onto a worthy successor.
