Almarra Forest is a large forest in Southeastern [[Nemna]]. The forest is home to many wood [[Elves]] and many other strange creatures. The forest is believed to have strong connections with the Fey-wild. 

Once a year, fey spirits appear in the forest led by one of the [[True Elves]], [[Lance which Pierces the Veil]], and go on a great hunt. Wood elves of the forest will often join this hunt. Other mortals have been caught in this strange event and returned with scrambled minds, if at all.
