Iartomita is a city that was founded by [[Emperor Iartome]] of [[Hen Ymorda]], who also built the nearby canal. It was built to capitalize on the natural trade and resources provided by the waters around the cape. It has become the center of the revitalization in [[Nemna|/Places Sulwaf/Nemna]]. The ancient city has once again become a rapidly growing, diverse metropolis rife with adventure opportunity. This is where the [[Guys Campaign]] will began.

Iartomita stretches across both sides of the canal, with a bridge spanning the waterway. The canal divides the city into two major sections, the east side and the west side. There are several neighborhoods, such as [[Gnometown]], within each of the major districts.[[Ithamon Tower]] is one of the most striking buildings in the city.

The west side of the city is a built on a hill made from some of the dirt excavated during the construction of the canal. This part of the city is where the city and county governments sit along with the city's temples and its wealthiest members. 

The east side of the city is where the vast majority of the population live. In recent years gangs have taken root in this district of the city and the city guard has had a difficult time combatting this from the other side of the bridge. Many of these gangs have been joining a loose organization known as [[The Friends]], through a complex affiliate system. 

[[The Brine Cloaks]] manage the Canal of Iartome, in particular the north and south gates which lead into and out of the city, as well as the great bridge which connects both sides of the city. They collect the taxes and fees associated with use of the canal that go directly to the king of [[Nemna]]. Because of their role in tax collection they are particularly hated by [[The Separatists]]. 

[[The Loyalists]] are primarily based on the western side of the city, where the [[Count Dravish]] holds court and where the majority of the city's elite reside. This is in contrast to [[The Separatists]] who are spread throughout the city, finding support from both the city's upper and lower crusts.
