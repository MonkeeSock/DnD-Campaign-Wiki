Iartomita is a city that was founded by Emperor Iartome of [[Hen Ymorda]], who also built the nearby canal. It was built to capitalize on the natural trade and resources provided by the waters around the cape. It has become the center of the revitalization in [[Nemna|/Places Sulwaf/Nemna]]. The ancient city has once again become a rapidly growing, diverse metropolis rife with adventure opportunity. This is where the [[Guys Campaign]] will begin.

Iartomita stretches across both sides of the canal, with a bridge spanning the waterway. The canal divides the city into two major sections, the east side and the west side. There are several neighborhoods within each of the major districts. 

The west side of the city is a built on a hill made from some of the dirt excavated during the construction of the canal. This part of the city is where the city and county governments sit along with the city's temples and its wealthiest members. 

The east side of the city is where the vast majority of the population live. In recent years gangs have taken root in this district of the city and the city guard has had a difficult time combatting this from the other side of the bridge. Many of these gangs have been joining a loose organization known as The Friends, through a complex affiliate system.
