Gnometown is a densely populated neighborhood in [[Iartomita]]. The homes were built for humans but have since been refitted for the [[Gnomes]] who predominately reside in the neighborhood. This, combined with the fact that [[Gnomes]] are generally more comfortable with dense living than other species, has allowed the neighborhood to become incredibly densely populated. 

Despite the dense population, Gnometown does not feel like an urban area. The buildings seem to spring out of dense trees and boulders which have been planted and placed in the neighborhood to allow new gnomes to be "born" in the area. Both rock gnomes and forest gnomes in live in the neighborhood.
