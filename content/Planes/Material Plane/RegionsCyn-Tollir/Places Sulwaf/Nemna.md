The largest kingdom in [[Sulwaf|/RegionsCyn-Tollir/Sulwaf]], Nemna became the dominant power in the region for the centuries after the collapse of [[Hen Ymorda]]. After a period of rapid growth and a brief golden age Nemna fell into a slow, ugly decline like the rest of the region. Since the return of the dragons, however, things have begun to change in the south west of the kingdom. On the Cape of Balkrin trade from the Celestial Empire, Caldoria, the Hobgoblins Archipelago, and even other planes has revitalized the region.Â 

This has led to conflicts of its own as the ancient capital of Nemna is far from the Cape but seeks to use this new wealth to fund an anticipated war with [[Admar]]. The people of the Cape of Balkrin, many of which are new immigrants, resent the demands of the capital leading to talks of independence. The debate is particularly heated in the city of [[Iartomita|/Places Sulwaf/Iartomita]]
