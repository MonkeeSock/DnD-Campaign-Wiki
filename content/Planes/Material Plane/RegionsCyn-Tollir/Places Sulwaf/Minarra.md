 Minarra is a village in southwestern [[Nemna]]. The village has a small port where ships will often stop on their way along to other bigger ports in the kingdom. For most of the village's history it has primarily exported lumber, as the village's proximity to [[Almarra Forest]] makes it a great source of raw materials.

The village was nearly destroyed during [[The Fiends Crisis]] but was saved largely by the actions of [[Callow]]. Prior to the crisis the village had been growing rapidly as the kingdom was expanding its navy, but suffered some major setback like the rest of the region after the crisis. It has begun to expand again as the logging industry has grown and made space for large orchards in the village. Since the crisis a large cider distillery has opened in the village and become another major export of the village.

The village is owned by [[Lord Phelton]]. [[Smendry]] is the village reeve. [[Reylar]] is the village fletcher and sculptor of a statue dedicated to [[Callow]]. [[Kal Rincar]] is the cider master in the village. Minarra was the primary location of [[Guys Campaign Session 4]].
