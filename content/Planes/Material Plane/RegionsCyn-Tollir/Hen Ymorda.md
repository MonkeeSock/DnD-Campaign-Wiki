A densely populated region in southern [[Cyn-Tollir|/Material Plane/Cyn-Tollir]] Hen Ymorda was the home of [[The Old Empire]], and means Old Empire in the human tongue. After [[The Collapse of Hen Ymorda]] the region broke into dozens of petty kingdoms until the majority of the region was united under [[The Celestial Empire]] by [[Adam Hadriel]] in order to combat [[Garsooth|/Dragon/Garsooth]] and his invading army. 

Hen Ymorda was the the setting of [[The Bandit Bashers]]/[[ChroNicles]] campaign. It is also the home of the first Applebee's.
