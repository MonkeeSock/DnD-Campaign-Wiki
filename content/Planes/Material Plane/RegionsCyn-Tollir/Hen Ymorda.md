A densely populated region in southern [[Cyn-Tollir|/Material Plane/Cyn-Tollir]] Hen Ymorda was the home of the Old Empire, and means Old Empire in the human tongue. After the collapse of Hen Ymorda the region broke into dozens of petty kingdoms until the majority of the region was united under the Celestial Empire by Adam Hadriel in order to combat [[Garsooth|/Dragon/Garsooth]] and his invading army. 

Hen Ymorda was the the setting of the Bandit Basher/ChroNicles campaign. It is also the home of the first Applebee's.
