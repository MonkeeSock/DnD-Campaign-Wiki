Daeda is a peninsula on the Northeast corner of [[Cyn-Tollir]]. It is a desert region as a result of the battle between [[Solva]] and [[Glamthring]] at the start of [[The Dragon Wars]]. The peninsula has since been home to many red [[Dragonborn]]. Thirty years ago [[Solva]] brought the region under his dominion and moved to conquer [[Wynion]].
