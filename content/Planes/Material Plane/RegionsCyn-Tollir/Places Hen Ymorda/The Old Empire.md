 The Old Empire was a human empire which dominated the continent of [[Cyn-Tollir]] for millennia. It is often referred to as Hen Ymorda in the human tongue and is what the region derives its name from. [[Hen Ymorda]] was the seat of The Old Empire's power. 

The Old Empire was founded by [[Decanthrose]] out of a rebellion against an ancient elvish empire on the continent. [[Decanthrose]] was deified by his subjects but was ultimately killed by the [[Elves]]. This led to deep seated animosity against them in The Old Empire which culminated in outright genocide after centuries of conflict. 

Despite the genocidal conquest the empire is still remembered as a golden age by many human societies. The Empire was particularly renowned for its achievements in architecture, among which was the construction of the Eternal Observatories.
