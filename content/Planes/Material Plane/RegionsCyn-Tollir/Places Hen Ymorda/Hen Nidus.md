Hen Nidus translates to ''The Old City'' in common. It is an ancient city in [[Hen Ymorda]] and was the capital of [[The Old Empire]]. Ever since the collapse of the Empire the kings of that city have considered themselves the true heirs of the empire, until Decanthrose VII swore fealty to [[Adam Hadriel]] and [[The Celestial Empire]].

After [[Garsooth]] was defeated the heirless Decanthrose VII passed his kingdom onto [[Illidan]]. Now the city and the surrounding region has become a place of greater opportunity and freedom for tieflings in the empire and the center of [[Draenyth]] worship in [[Hen Ymorda]].
