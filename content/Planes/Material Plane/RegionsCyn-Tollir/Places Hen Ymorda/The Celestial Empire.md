The Celestial Empire is an empire founded by [[The Bandit Bashers]] in the region of [[Hen Ymorda]]. It is currently led by [[Adam Hadriel]], who became a minor deity during his adventures. 

The Empire was founded using the artefacts of [[Decanthrose]] in order to unite the region and prepare for the threat posed by [[Garsooth]] and his invading army. While not every kingdom in the region has fallen under the empire's banner, it has become the major power in the region.
