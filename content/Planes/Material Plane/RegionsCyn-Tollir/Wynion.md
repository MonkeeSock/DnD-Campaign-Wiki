Wynion is the large central region of [[Cyn-Tollir]] and was once the capital region of an Elvish Empire on the continent. The [[Elves]] were destroyed by [[The Old Empire]] and without their presence the region has mostly become grassy planes and rolling hills. After the collapse of Hen Ymorda the region was dominated by city states until they were untied into the Wynonian League, mostly by the actions of members of [[The Twilight Tavern]], in order to prepare for the region for an invasion by [[Solva]].
