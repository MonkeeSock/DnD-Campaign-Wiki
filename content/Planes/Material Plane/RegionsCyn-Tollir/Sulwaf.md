Like most of the continent ([[Cyn-Tollir|/Material Plane/Cyn-Tollir]]), Sulwaf was conquered by the Old Empire. After its collapse Sulwaf fell into a mess of petty kingdoms and rivalries. Over time the region slid into a backwater, and change came slowly. 

Over a period of centuries a group of elves moved into Sulwaf and once there was a large enough community they founded their own kingdom, Admar, in the center of the region. The new kingdom soon attracted huge influxes of elves and after centuries of inactivity Sulwaf entered a period of rapid change. Admar swiftly conquered its neighbors, absorbing some and displacing others. The other kingdoms looked to [[Nemna|/Places Sulwaf/Nemna]] for protection but before war could break out rumors spread of dragons returning to the world.

Conflict broke out in the Dragonborn tribes north of Sulwaf and the black dragon Caldoris began preventing elves from journeying to Admar. The elves marched on Caldoris who had been planning to invade Wynion from the West and made good progress before the dragon could respond with his own armies. By the time the forces clashed Caldoris had seen the fates of Solva and Garsooth unfold so he remained out of direct conflict. 

The elves and dragonborn fought to a standstill and a treaty was secured. There was no change in territory  but elves were allowed to travel through The Tribes to Admar and Admar agreed to bar metallic dragonborn refugees from entering their kingdom. In the thirty years since Caldoris has unleashed untold horrors on the metallic dragonborn, many of which have fled to Nemna. Most of the metallic clans have been eliminated or left the region but some still cross the border every day. Admar still seeks to dominate Sulwaf, and Nemna is their greatest rival and the refugee dragonborn look for security wherever it may be found.
