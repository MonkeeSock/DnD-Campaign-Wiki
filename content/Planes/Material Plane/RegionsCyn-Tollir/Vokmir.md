Vokmir is a region on [[Cyn-Tollir]] which is currently dominated by the kingdom of [[Caldoria]]. The region was the home of many groups of dragon born. Towards the end of [[The Dragon Wars]] the [[Dragons]] and their armies assembled in the region for one final, great battle. Before the battle could truly begin, however, the [[Dragons]] disappeared. The gathered armies settled in the region, fighting amongst themselves and forming new societies there, carrying on the conflict for thousands of years. 

In common the region is sometimes called The Tribes or The Clan Holds.
