 Namaak is a city in [[Wynion]]. It was where the [[Wynonian Knights]] campaign began and where much of that campaign was centered around. It is one of the most powerful and influential cities in the region and the [[Wynonian League]]. 

The city has a council that serves as the city's legislative body and a powerful executive that rules the city and represents it in the league. Currently, that position is held for life by Kris Kringle.
