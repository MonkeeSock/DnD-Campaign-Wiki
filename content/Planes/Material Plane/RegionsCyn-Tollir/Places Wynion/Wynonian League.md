The Wynonian League is a political entity composed of several, formerly independent, city states in [[Wynion]]. The league was founded after Wynlow formed a new alliance to challenge the power of Namaak and its allied city states. Members of [[The Twilight Tavern]] were involved as leaders and soldiers on both sides of the war which resulted from the new alliance. 

Currently, every city state is a member of the league and is able to vote in matters brought to a general council comprised of league members. Each member of the league has a number of votes which is dependent on the size of the city and its involvement in the war. Those who were on the "winning" side of the war were given outsize influence over the others. 

Overall, the league has made the region more stable and united. This was critical in the defeat of [[Solva]] as the region was only able to raise an army large enough to challenge the dragon's together, not divided. 

In the thirty years since the dragon's defeat the league has faced significant internal strife. There is still resentment left over from the war that formed the league, especially over the relative power the members have in voting.

The league has been hold together only by certain key figures and the lingering threat posed by [[Caldoria]] in [[Vokmir]].
