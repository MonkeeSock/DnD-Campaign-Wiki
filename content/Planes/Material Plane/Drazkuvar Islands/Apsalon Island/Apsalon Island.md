Apsalon Island is the largest island of [[Drazkuvar]]. It is ruled by a Dwarvish High King. [[Dwarves]] make up the bulk of the ruling class but the island has a large population of [[Humans]] as well. Their populations are concentrated in the southern portion of the island and there are a number of human principalities in that region which rule under the High King. 

The island is mostly mountainous terrain and terraced farming is a common practice. The political capital of the island is the dwarven stronghold of Karakur. The island's largest and most populous city, however, is on its southern tip and is called Maritome.  

The island is named for the angel Apsalon, who is chief among those worshipped in the [[Drazkuvar]] faith.
