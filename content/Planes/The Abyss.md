 The Abyss is the source of all Demons and was torn open by [[Gruumsh]] during [[The War of the Gods]]. Creatures of The Abbys have been twisted by [[Entropy]] and seek only to sow chaos and destruction. 

The plane is often described as a bottomless pit with roiling masses of pure chaos and demons making the walls of the infinite chasm. The area which surrounds The Abyss itself is made of jagged, cruel rocks which rise and fall without pattern.
