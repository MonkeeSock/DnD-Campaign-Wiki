Hell is ruled by [[Asmodeus]] and several other [[Archdevils]]. Hell solidified as a plane during [[The War of the Gods]] and is where souls that have been corrupted by [[Devils]] reside after death. 

Souls which have been corrupted eventually are made into [[Devils]] themselves and recruited to fight in The Blood War against the [[Demons]]. Hell is not necessarily a place of punishment and torment for the wicked, although many would consider becoming a devil a horrible fate. Only someone who has explicitly sold their soul to a devil ends up in Hell.
