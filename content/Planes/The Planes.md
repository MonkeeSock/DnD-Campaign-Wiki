The Planes took on their current form and alignment during [[The War of the Gods]]. While the planes are generally separate, it is possible to physically travel between them. This most often occurs when sailing over open water. This kind of planar travel can only be done intentionally with immense difficulty and skill, otherwise it only ever occurs accidentally when sailors are simply seeking other places on [[The Material Plane]]. 

The most well known planes are: 
	[[The Material Plane]],
	[[Hell]],
	[[The Abyss]]
