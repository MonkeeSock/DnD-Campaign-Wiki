 The Shadowfell was originally the home of [[Draenyth]] and the land of death, until it was conquered by [[Al Na'sar]] and his followers. It is a dark, shadow covered reflection of [[The Material Plane]]. 

Nothing grows in the Shadowfell, it is a place of slow, stagnant decay. The mountains are ground to bare nubs of hills, bare of trees and flowers and the stone cities are gray and quiet. The majority of the people who live in the Shadowfell are the Shadar Kai, once elves who followed [[Al Na'sar]] to his new realm. Their skin is as gray as the cities they live in and the plane which surrounds them so that they blend in to the point of being invisible.
