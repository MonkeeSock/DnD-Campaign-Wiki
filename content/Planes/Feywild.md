 The Feywild is the plane of chaotic nature. It was originally created by [[Val]] and is now the home of the [[True Elves]] and other fey creatures.

The Feywild is a reflection [[The Material Plane]] but overgrown with thick vines, trees and grass. In the Feywild there the green is greener than any on green on [[The Material Plane]]. [[Al Na'sar]] once attempted to conquer the plane during [[The War of the Gods]].
