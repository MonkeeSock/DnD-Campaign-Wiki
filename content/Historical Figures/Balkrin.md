 Balkrin was a historical figure in the region of [[Sulwaf]], remembered for his resistance against the first conquests of [[The Old Empire]]. He became the king of Incordia for time, where his lineage ruled in the period between his rebellion and the eventual, successful conquest of the region. 

During [[The Collapse of Hen Ymorda]] Balkrin became a potent symbol for the people in rebellion across [[Sulwaf]]. Ninety years ago, someone claiming to be the direct descendent of Balkrin took control of Incordia. He ruled there for several decades until the founding of [[Admar]], when he was assassinated by a former ally. Incordia became the bedrock which [[Admar]] was founded on.
