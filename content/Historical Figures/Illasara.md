 Illasara was an elvish queen who ruled a vast empire that dominated the continent of [[Illaset]] and even large portions of [[Cyn-Tollir]] at its height. The Illasaran Empire was the first great civilization to rise out of the ashes of [[The Dragon Wars]]. Much of the Empire's early history is unrecorded. In particular, the exact origins of Illasara herself are much disputed. 

While her exact age is unknown, it is generally agreed that Illasara lived an extraordinarily long life even for an Elf. It is generally agrees that she had lived over a thousand years before her death. Some scholars have estimated a life which stretched over three millennia but this is generally on the high end of estimates. 

Illasara's parentage is completely unknown as are the details of her rise to power. In many myths Illasara is born of the land itself and has no parents, suggesting that she is named after the continent and not the other way around. Virtually nothing is known about her rise to power, and the earliest records available begin well into her reign, after she was already considered a great queen. 

The exact parentage of Illasara's own children is a matter of mystery as well.  Although the historical was well established by this time, the only information available comes from a myth which suggests a marriage between Illasara and the land itself, resulting in the children. After this period the written record and oral tradition begin to refer to Illasara as Illasaris as well, using the two names interchangeably. 

Among the many legends associated with Illasara are six glass eyes known as the Eyes of Illasaris. These eyes are said to contain all of the recorded information in the world. After her death, one eye was passed onto each of her children. The red eye cracked upon her death, corrupting it and by extension her son Erendael. Conflicts over the eyes were ultimately what tore her empire apart. Since Illasara there have been very few who held all six eyes. All those who have held all of the eyes are referred to as Visionaries.
