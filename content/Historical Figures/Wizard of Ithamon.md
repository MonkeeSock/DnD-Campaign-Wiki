The Wizard of Ithamon is the title of the current ruler of [[Ithamon Tower]]. They are also sometimes referred to as the Warden of Ithamon Tower. The first Warden was Ithamon himself, who built the tower. To the anger of many [[Elves]], his own successor was not an elf, which began a long tradition of selecting the most capable successor beyond any other considerations. 

The current wizard of Ithamon is [[Calum Quaide Kincaid]].
