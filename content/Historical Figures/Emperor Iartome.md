Emperor Iartome was an emperor of Hen Ymorda who conquered a portion [[Sulwaf]]. He is, however, much better remembered for his other engineering accomplishments. In what is now [[Nemna]], Iartome built and named a city after himself called [[Iartomita]]. He also made a massive canal which cuts through The [[Cape of Balkrin]] in the southwestern part of the region.
