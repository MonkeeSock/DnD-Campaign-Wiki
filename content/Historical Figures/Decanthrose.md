 Decanthrose was the founder and first emperor of [[The Old Empire]]. Little is known about his early life but is generally accepted that he served as a general for the city of [[Hen Nidus]], before becoming a king there. Eventually he went on to conquer the rest of the region now known as [[Hen Ymorda]]. 

Conflicts arose with [[Elves]] and their empire on [[Cyn-Tollir]] early in his reign. The elves considered the Empire a vassal state of their own empire. Tensions came to a head when an elvish prince murdered a human in Hen Ymorda and war was declared.

Decanthrose marched his army over the Grey Mountains and secured [[The Old Empire]]'s status as an independent nation. As he pressed on, however, he was killed and martyred by the elves.
