This was the second campaign of NQ D&D Club, and the first in this setting. The campaign followed the party primarily in their adventures to begin a proto-communist revolt in the kingdom of Incordia and place Balkrin the Younger in power. The revolt led to a brutal war and Balkrin went back on his promises of a democratic system to become a dictator. He was assassinated in the epilogue of the campaign during the founding of [[Admar]]. 

A psychic donkey played a major role in the rebellion.
