Calum Quaide Kincaid is the current [[Wizard of Ithamon]]. He is notably reclusive and rarely leaves [[Ithamon Tower]]. Both [[The Separatists]] and [[The Loyalists]] of [[Iartomita]] have petitioned for his support in each of their causes but he has remained silent on the issue. It is said he helped [[Count Dravish]] summon [[Devils]] to his aid during the [[The Fiends Crisis]]. 

Calum has written many treatises on a variety of subjects including 
	[[Dragon Reincarnation]]
