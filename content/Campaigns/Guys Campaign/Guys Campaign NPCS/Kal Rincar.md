Kal Rincar was the cider master of [[Minarra]]. After being ordered to reduce labor costs Rincar got in touch with cult of [[Azorack]] and used their services to summon fiends to operate the cider press. He eventually agreed to help the cult smuggle captives through the village, past [[The Brine Cloaks]]. The party met him in [[Guys Campaign Session 4]], where he escaped during a fight in the cider mill.
