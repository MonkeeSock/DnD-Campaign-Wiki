Amaryllis Torbuck is the daughter of Cormac Torbuck, a legendary resistance fighter against [[Caldoria]] in [[Vokmir]]. Cormac was killed in the disaster at [[Kelwar's Gap]] and the Torbuck clan was scattered. Amaryllis and her followers remained in [[Vokmir]] in the time since the disaster until they were eventually captured. Amaryllis and her surviving clan members were put on a ship and sent to [[Almarra Forest]] to be sacrificed but were rescued during [[Guys Campaign Session 2]].
