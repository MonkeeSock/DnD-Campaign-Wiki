This campaign is currently in preparation and the title of the campaign may change.

This campaign will take place in the kingdom [[Nemna]], specifically starting in the city of [[Iartomita]]. The kingdom is currently under tension from a variety of threats and social issues. Their is a constant threat of invasion from [[Admar]], a refugee crisis of [[Dragonborn]] from [[Vokmir]] caused by [[Caldor]] and his new kingdom [[Caldoria]]. 

Within [[Nemna]] itself there is a strong independence growing in [[Iartomita]] and the rest of the county. Since the revitalization of sailing in [[Hen Ymorda]] trade has flowed into the county, largely thanks to the Canal of Iartome. The king of [[Nemna]] collects a steep tax on ships passing through the canal which goes directly to his coffers. The ancient canal is in need of major repairs and adjustments but so far the county government has paid for these projects exclusively. 

The current members of the party are:
	[[Lykopsaro]],
	[[Gris]],
	[[Lucien]],
	[[Sinwar Nakla Conghaile Hassan]],
	[[Ronnie]]
