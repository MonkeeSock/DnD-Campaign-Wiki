 The Separatists are those in [[Iartomita]] and County Dravish that seek independence for the county. While the movement has become rather popular it has yet to coalesce around any individual leaders. Despite the fractured nature of the movement there are some prominent members including [[Count Dravish]]'s half-brother [[Lord Duvall]].
