 In [[Iartomita]] and the surrounding lands there is  growing independence movement. Those opposed to independence call themselves "Loyalists", as they are still loyal to the king. This faction is largely led by [[Count Dravish]], the current ruler of [[Iartomita]] and the surrounding county. 

While those who consider themselves loyalists generally share common goals and beliefs, there are fractures within the faction. Some support the king and his policies while others are against his policies but remain loyal out of faith in monarchy, loyalty to the count or fear of [[Admar]]. Those who fear [[Admar]] believe a divided [[Nemna]] would be crushed by the [[Elves]].
