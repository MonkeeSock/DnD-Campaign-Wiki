20th - 24th of New Rains

The party began in [[Iartomita]] meeting in [[Lucien]]'s apartment. [[Sinwar Nakla Conghaile Hassan]] arrived with [[Ronnie]], a new member of the party. [[Amaryllis]] arrived shortly after to discuss the party's next steps in pursuing the cult of [[Azorack]]. The party and [[Amaryllis]] decided to travel to [[Minarra]] and meet with [[Kal Rincar]], the enslaver's point of contact in the village. 

After an easy trip along the coast the party arrived in the village and spent some time exploring. They spent some time exploring and found a wooden statue dedicated to [[Callow]]. They then entered the village's one tavern and talked to the locals there. The innkeeper was dwarven woman and the only to patrons at the time were a human named [[Smendry]] and an elf named [[Reylar]]. 

They learned that [[Smendry]] was the village Reeve and a minor arcanist while [[Reylar]] was a wood elf who helped defend the village during [[The Fiends Crisis]] and decided to remain in the village. He carved the statue dedicated to [[Callow]] and now served as the village fletcher. They also learned that [[Kal Rincar]] was the "Cider Master" of the village and that he often spent his evenings at the tavern. 

The party waited for Rincar to arrive and [[Lucien]] disguised himself as the dragonborn he was originally supposed to meet. They lured him onto [[The Maiden]] where [[Gris]] grabbed and subdued him. The party interrogated Rincar, who was fairly forthcoming with his information. It was clear, however, that Rincar was trying to minimize who his own dealing with cult and guilt, while being helpful enough to save his own neck. [[Lucien]] used the spell detect thoughts to help pick apart some of Rincar's lies. Ultimately the party discovered that Rincar had been paid to help smuggle the captives through the village, past [[The Brine Cloaks]] and into [[Almarra Forest]]. The cult had made contact with Rincar because he had used their services to summon fiends to operate his cider press and reduce labor costs. The order to reduce costs had come from [[Lord Phelton]], the lord of the village. 

The party set a trap in the cider mill which had an upper loft and a lower flower with an apple grinder, press and vats for the cider. The party his in empty barrels in the loft and set up some barrels to roll into the cultists after they entered. Rincar lured the cultists into the mill and even brought the leader to the edge by the apple grinder. The party sprung out of the barrels and surprised the cultists, dropping some of the regular cultists immediately. The barrels were released, knocking the leader's bodyguard prone and damaging some of the other cultists. 

By the time the cultists were able to act most of them had already been killed and the leader had been thrown into the apple grinder, which quickly killed him. This was done by [[Amaryllis]] tossing him in and [[Lucien]] using command to force him to drop in. [[Amaryllis]] tried to throw the bodyguard in but was instead thrown in herself, just managing to catch the edge of the loft above the machinery. The bodyguard was soon thrown in after and [[Ronnie]] helped [[Amaryllis]] climb out from the grinder. Rincar managed to escape during the fight.

A final cultist was captured and interrogated by the party, but when they threatened him with pain they found him excited by this. They learned that he believed [[Azorack]] was a demon and "The Lord of Pain". Again [[Lucien]] was able to obtain the information they needed through detect thoughts and learned the information the party needed. The party was able to learn the location of the cult's hideout and the fact that [[Amaryllis]]'s father was being kept their.
