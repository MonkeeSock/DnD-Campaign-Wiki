11th-17th of New Rains

The party spent a week on downtime doing various activities. [[Lucien]] spent his time researching the presence of [[Devils]] in [[Iartomita]] and ended up looking into the common narrative of [[The Fiends Crisis]]. It is generally believed that part of the deal made by [[Count Dravish]] allowed for [[Devils]] to use the city's ports and canal. The canal and ports, however, are run by [[The Brine Cloaks]] who represent the king of [[Nemna]], not Dravish. Something in the official story doesn't add up but that's all h could uncover. 

[[Lucien]] also spent time connecting with the spirits and his taroka deck. He first made contact with the spirit of the thug killed by [[Charity]]. He charged [[Lucien]] with caring for his younger, orphaned brother. [[Lucien]] protected him from a distance to start but eventually convinced him to join an orphanage in the city. 

[[Gris]] spent his downtime pit fighting to make up for some of the money spent on curing his lycanthropy in the past. He lost most of his fights but won against another up and coming fighter in the pits named Valdemar. This drew the ire of much of the crowd, particularly his chromatic dragonborn following. After his fights he spent time on introspection and unlocked his echo knight abilities. 

[[Lykopsaro]] spent his time performing religious services and duties in the temple district of [[Iartomita]]. Much of his time was spent at the temple of [[Elslyn]] which has a shrine dedicated to [[Glamthring]] within it. While there he met Torbera, a leader at the temple and did her a favor, which he may call on to have returned later. 

18th of New Rains

The adventure with [[Sinwar Nakla Conghaile Hassan]] hearing about a human trafficking ship from [[Caldor]] that was looking to pass through the Canal of Iartome. Sinwar knew to stop this ship he needed a crew and a ship. He tracked down the party and explained the situation, knowing there would likely be some payable bounty if they succeeded. With that Sinwar joined the party and they made their way to the docks. 

As the party searched the docks they met a crew led by a man named Tristan. His crew had a found a ship called [[The Maiden]] ready to be claimed for salvage rights but as they had boarded earlier they began to believe the ship was haunted due to some strange happenings on board. 

As the party boarded a boom nearly knocked [[Lykopsaro]] off the deck and giggling was heard throughout the ship. As they went deeper in they were given visions of  a warm, enticing beach and the the door to the captain's quarters swung open invitingly. They found three small depressions where it seemed some kind of disk could be inserted, with a symbols for water, air and stars in them. As they entered the captain's quarters they heard a voice ring in each of there heads declaring the party to be her new crew and asking them to "Find my soul". 

The party left the ship to speak with [[Captain Tallanvor]] to find more information about the previous owners of the ship. They found it had been registered with the Opal Trading Company and the dock fees prepaid for twenty years. With an address in hand the party went to speak with the last owner of [[The Maiden]], Samuel Tai. 

They arrived at a dusty, rarely visited shop that sold sea charts and nautical equipment. As they entered the were greeted by an old, decrepit elf who introduced himself as Samuel Tai. As the party explained their experiences on [[The Maiden]] Samuel became excited that [[The Maiden]] seemed to have chosen a new crew.

He explained the history of the ship, saying ancestors of his had become lost in the [[Feywild]] after an intense storm. They meant one of the [[True Elves]] there, The Maiden Who Dances on Stars, and as they made repairs to their ship she became close friends with the crew. As they departed she decided to join the crew, leaving the [[Feywild]] and sacrificing some of her own immortality. On one of their adventures she was nearly killed and so she put the last of her divinity into the discs to become one with the ship. Samuel handed the party one of the discs, which would allow [[The Maiden]] to set sail. 

After they inserted the disc the ship seemed to light up and spring to life. The figure of a woman appeared, carved into the mast. This was The Maiden Who Dances on Stars herself, or what remained of her. After some introductions the party spoke with Tristan and his crew, deciding to each have half "ownership" of [[The Maiden]]. 

At this point [[Captain Tallanvor]] arrived explaining that the ship Sinwar had been looking for had attempted to come through the canal and [[The Brine Cloaks]] had tried to apprehend the ship and its crew. The ship had managed to escape and sail away from [[Iartomita]]. Tallanvor and the party set sail to chase in [[The Maiden]]. 

The party managed to catch up to the ship and Sinwar launched a grapple hooked ballista at the enemy ship to prevent it from escaping and killing one of the black dragonborn crew. The crews of each ship exchanged a series of ranged attacks before The Miaden rammed into the other ship.

As the ships collided Sinwar kept his distance landing devastating shots on the enemy captain and [[Gris]] and Tallanvor rushed into the melee, preventing the enemies from rusihing Sinwar.  [[Lucien]] used his bardic spirits to support his allies and disadvantage the opposing crew with vicious mockery. [[Lykopsaro]] did serious damage with blinding flashes of light and fire spells. 

In a critical move [[Lucien]] commanded the [[Dragonborn]] captain to drop and Sinwar used his swarm to push him off the edge of the ship. With him left behind in the water the rest of crew was either quickly defeated or soon surrendered.

Once the crew was dispatched the party went below deck to free the prisoners on board. They found a group of golden [[Dragonborn]] of the Torbuck clan. Sinwar recognized [[Amaryllis]] Torbuck, daughter of Cormac Torbuck who had been a key figure in the [[Dragis Balor]] movement until he was killed in the disaster at [[Kelwar's Gap]].

After speaking with the prisoners, interrogating the crew and retrieving the captain to interrogate him, the party determined that the captives were being brought to [[Almarra Forest]] as a sacrifices to the Cult of Azorack. 

The captain was spared and taken prisoner under the promise he would lure other similar ships into traps where they could be captured. The rest of the crew was executed to [[Captain Tallanvor]]'s disapproval. The party then returned home to [[Iartomita]], with plans to continue on to [[Almarra Forest]].
