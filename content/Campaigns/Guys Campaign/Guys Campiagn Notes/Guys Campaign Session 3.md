19th of New Rains

The session began the day after [[Guys Campaign Session 2]] took place, on Iartome's Day. The holiday began as a celebration of [[Emperor Iartome]] and takes place on his birthday. In the years since the collapse of [[The Old Empire]] the holiday has come to celebrate the city of [[Iartomita]] and its history rather than the Emperor. 

The day began with a parade and short ceremony in the temple district to begin the celebrations. The day featured a number of activities including a shooting competition, wrestling tournament and a pie eating contest.

[[Lucien]] participated in the shooting contest against [[Charity]]. Despite her attempts to cheat and tamper with the competition [[Lucien]] still managed to win. He took home a bit of gold and a ceremonial dagger, arrow and crossbow to commemorate the competition. 

[[Gris]] and [[Lykopsaro]] participated in the wrestling match. In the first round [[Lykopsaro]] faced Judd and won the round, in part to his use of the spell enhance ability. In the next round [[Lykopsaro]] and [[Gris]] faced each other. [[Gris]] ultimatelywon the round after some back and forth. 

[[Gris]] went on to face Valdemar, a dragonborn he had defeated in pit fighting rings. Valdemar was adept at slipping from grapples and holds but was ultimately unable to pin [[Gris]] and suffered another, even more public defeat. 

In the final round [[Gris]] faced off against [[Captain Tallanvor]], who fought in quite a dirty fashion despite his honorable reputation. Ultimately, [[Gris]] won the competition but Tallanvor won the award of crowd favorite. Gris won some gold and garland, and Tallanvor won some gold as well. 

During the wrestling match [[Lykopsaro]] spoke with Samuel Tai to learn more about [[The Maiden]] and [[Calum Quaide Kincaid]]. Samuel was not able to provide much information about either, but did ask to spend some time sailing with [[The Maiden]] when it was convenient to the party. 

Finally, there was a pie eating competition to end the games of the day. Judd, [[Lykopsaro]], [[Gris]], [[Lucien]] and [[Crazy Ike]] all participated. Judd was the victor of last years competition, narrowly beating [[Crazy Ike]]. This year, however, Judd performed badly and [[Crazy Ike]] destroyed the competition earning a garland made to fit around his belly. 

After the competitions there was a bonfire held on the beach. The party got a chance to catch up with each other about the days events and spent some time speaking with [[Amaryllis]] Torbuck, who thanks them again for rescuing her the day before. The party discussed there plans to move on the cult of Azorack. There was some discussion of the recently rescued Torbuck clan moving against the cult with the party, but it seemed that they were more inclined to rest and recuperate from their captivity for the time being. 

To end the night the party watched a play depicting a story from [[The Fiends Crisis]]. Usually the plays on the holiday are about the city's history, but this particular one focused on the events in a village called [[Minarra]]. 

The play followed the history of the village's resistance against Demonic Hordes that invaded the region during the crisis Through the combined forces of the villagers, local wood elves, a druid circle and a warlock named [[Callow]] the village was able to put up a desperate, impossible last stand. They held out against the horde that destroyed the regular army and even destroyed the horde later on without the assistance of devils later summoned by [[Count Dravish]]. This victory was largely due to some eldritch power unleashed by [[Callow]] before he was sucked beneath the ground, never to be seen again. 

As part of their rewards for winning earlier in the day [[Lucien]] and [[Gris]] were given minor roles in the play.
