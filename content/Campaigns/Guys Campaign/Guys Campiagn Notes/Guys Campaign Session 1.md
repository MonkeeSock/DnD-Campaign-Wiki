The campaign began in the city of [[Iartomita]]. The players were all in a tavern called The Bard and the Bees. As the party ordered their drinks rats they heard thumps in the basement. As they went to investigate a number of rats burst out of the basement and attacked the party. The rest of the bystanders in the tavern fled the building, except a tiefling woman who leapt over the table and helped the party fight the rats. 

The party leapt into action. [[Gris]] punched and kicked the rats, [[Lucien]] used psychic spells, [[Lykopsaro]] used his mace and divine magic and the tiefling woman used her gun. After the rats had been dealt with she introduced herself as [[Charity]] and invited the party to meet her at another place called the Crab Street Inn. She then left before any guards arrived to investigate the scene.

The party made their way to Crab St. and found [[Charity]] at the inn among other members of her gang, the Crab St. Gang. [[Charity]] offered to pay the party if they investigated a series of rat attacks that had been occurring on her gang's turf. The places attacked had become affiliated with a new gang called the Fowe gang. Another member of the gang, Maurice, offered the party more coin if they would trash one of the places, Judd's. The party took [[Charity]]'s offer. 

Between Judd's and the library the party learned that the Fowe gang had offered to protect Judd's from the rats and learned that Fowe translated into rat in Hen Ymordan. While their they spoke to an eladrin named Evarran. [[Lucien]] was invited to some non-descript illicit activity at the docks the next morning, but the party never showed up. 

The party then investigated a magic shop called Pevarra's. There they learned with decent certainty that the Fowe gang had sent the rats, but even though Pevarra knew this she went along with them in the hopes of avoiding being caught in a turf war. They also learned that the gang met in the back room of her place and had a meeting planned tonight. [[Lucien]] left a lock of his hair there to do a remote viewing later. 

The party returned to the Crab St. Inn and informed [[Charity]] of what they had learned. They attempted to discourage Maurice from attacking Judd's with his brothers and revealed what they knew to him as well. 

The next day they attempted the remote viewing and saw members of the Fowe gang waiting in ambush for them, meaning someone had warned the gang. The party surmised Maurice was the rat. They returned to Crab St. to confront him and as he tried to leave the inn the party attacked him and a fight broke out.

Maurice and his brothers were revealed to be wererats. The party believed the fight was in their favor but as they and the gangsters attacked they saw Maurice and his brothers were immune to most damage. The rats did major damage to [[Gris]] but he managed to stay standing, despite gaining lycanthropy. In the end, one of Maurice's brothers was killed and two of the Crab St. gang members lay dead in the inn as Maurice and his other brother escaped. 

After curing [[Gris]]'s lycnathropy the party met with [[Charity]] at Crab St. She provided the party with silvered weapons to fight Maurice and her gang captured a gangster to guide the party to Maurice's lair. After the interrogation he revealed the directions and was killed by [[Charity]], despite the assurances from the party she would not kill him. 

The party entered the sewers and found Maurice's lair. Two pipes poured a stream of grease into puddles in the lair. After an attempt at convincing the party to join him and a monologue the party attacked Maurice, his brother and some giant rats. [[Gris]] took some major damage but healing from the other members of the party managed to keep him fighting. After the brother and rats were killed [[Gris]] dragged Maurice into one puddle of grease and [[Lykopsaro]] lit him and the Grease on fire. 

There was an explosion further up the pipe as the grease ignited and Maurice, close to death, charged into the second puddle of grease. The grease caught fire and there was an explosion further up the pipe. The party dove out of the lair into the water as its ceiling collapsed around them.

The party collected their money and the session ended with Maurice and his brother dead and buried beneath a pile of rubble.
