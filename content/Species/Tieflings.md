At some point early on in the short history of humanity several groups of [[Humans]] made pacts with some fiendish entities. As a result of this pact the descendents of these [[Humans]] often manifest fiendish traits. Most often these features are slight, such as a small pair of horns or goat-like eyes. Sometimes these features are numerous and more pronounced causing the person to look more fiendish than human. In human dominated societies tieflings often face extreme prejudice for their fiendish ancestry, while other cultures are more tolerant. The blue dragon [[Garsooth]] even held tieflings in high regard due to their fiendish origins.
