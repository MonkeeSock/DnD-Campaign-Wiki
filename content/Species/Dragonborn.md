Some say that during [[The War of the Gods]] the [[Dragons]] were created to be used as weapons during the war. Some of these dragons were corrupted by entities of the lower planes, creating the chromatic dragons. Once the war ended the gods largely left [[The Material Plane]], and the dragons, to their own devices. Others believe the dragons were summoned after the war to shepherd the plane and its inhabitants.  

The dragons created their own species, the dragonborn, and built empires across the material plane. These empires became incredibly advanced in magic and science but came crashing down when the Dragon’s inevitably went to war with each other. 

Dragonborn reflect the appearance of the dragon who created them:

Gold: These dragonborn have golden scales and catfish-like facial features, including fins, whiskers and barbs. Their heads tend to be fish shaped as well. 

Silver: While these dragonborn may have some scales in areas around the eyes and at joints like the elbows and knees, they are mostly covered in silver feathers. Their eyes and face are birdlike and they may even have beaks. 

Copper: These dragonborn are mostly covered in copper fur but may have scales growing over large parts of their body as well. Their features are generally vulpine and they may have whiskers.

Brass: These dragonborn have scales and lizard-like features. They look the most like a classic fantasy dragon.

Bronze: While these dragonborn are also mostly lizard-like, they also have large, often ornate, antlers. 

Blue: These dragonborn are eel-like and have small fins on their bodies. Some of these dragonborn may have a single horn protruding from their head. 

Red: Like brass dragonborn these dragonborn are lizard-like in appearance but are usually covered in hard, black spikes.

White: Instead of scales these dragonborn are covered in thick, white fur. They are generally beastial in appearance.

Green: With green scales these dragonborn are serpent-like in appearance. They have serpentine fangs and often have an inflatable hood like cobras. 

Black: Instead of scales these dragonborn have a black carapace. Their features are insectile, sometimes having mandibles around or instead of their mouth. They also have compound eyes, similar to flies, mantis and other insects.
