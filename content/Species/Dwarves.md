The first dwarf, [[Dumathoin]] was shaped out of stone by [[Teitheo]], the God of craftsmanship and the arts. As a result the dwarves have a natural affinity for rock and stone, often dwelling in mountains, on stony cliffs and rugged hills. Dwarven culture highly values craftsmanship and as a result have created some of the greatest works of architecture and art. Dwarves, however, have little regard for things that grow and many dwarven civilizations practice very little agriculture. Instead they will trade crafted goods, anything from weapons and armor to jewelry or nails, for food goods. Because of this dwarves have a reputation as shrewd traders.
