 Like [[Halflings]], the origins of humanity are either unknown or long forgotten but it is often said that humans crawled from the mud itself. Unlike halflings, it is known humans appeared only a handful of thousands of years ago. Since they appeared in [[The Material Plane]] humans have spread rapidly and quickly building sprawling kingdoms and empires. They have since become the most common species found across the material plane, even making up the majority of the population in [[Illaset]].
