Â Before [[The War of the Gods]] elves were carved from the trees by a now dead god, [[Val]]. After the ancient draconic empires fell elvish empires and kingdoms rose across the [[The Material Plane]]. Elves are the only species to have built civilizations rivaling the sophistication and power of the draconic empires. These civilizations began to collapse, however, as human civilizations rose. High elves either integrated into these new civilizations or clung to their own, while wood elves returned the forests they were first created from.
