No one is entirely certain of halflingâ€™s origins. Halflings have never built continent spanning empires or powerful kingdoms, instead preferring to reside in their small and homely shires. Often these shires go ignored by the powers that be, almost always allowed to function autonomously. Despite their lack of civilization building halflings almost always appear in the histories of other cultures, often in the most unexpected of ways.
