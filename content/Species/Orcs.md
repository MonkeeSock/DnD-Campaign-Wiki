When orcs created by [[Gruumsh]] they were primarily made as revenge against the now dead elf God, [[Val]]. Orcs are a hermaphroditic species but are unable to carry their own young. As a result they must implant their eggs into other species in a parasitic relationship. The young orcs eat their way out of the host when born, causing extreme damage and sometimes killing the host. While orcs can use most species as hosts, orc cultures which still worship Gruumsh prefer to use [[Elves]] as hosts.
