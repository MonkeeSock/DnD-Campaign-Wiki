Gnomes are a species that do not sexually reproduce, instead they spontaneously appear from unworked stone or wood. Often gnomes appear as a result of situations of extreme whimsy.  This is reflected in gnomish naming conventions which tend to be whimsical and upbeat. Common names include: Joy, Twinkle and Tweedle. Traditional Gnome societies are the best example of the saying, “It takes a village to raise a child.” Because gnomes appear spontaneously they rarely have individual parents, instead being raised by the entire gnomish community together. In [[Illaset]], however, [[Garsooth]]’s empire worked to erode this tradition, instead forcing many gnomes to adopt lifestyles similar to traditional [[Dragonborn]] ones.
