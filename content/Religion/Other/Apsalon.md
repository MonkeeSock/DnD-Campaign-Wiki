**Bio:** Apsalon is the chief deity of the [[Drazkuvar]] faith. As the continent sunk, Apsalon was one of the servants of the [[Prime Deities]] sent to prevent the catastrophe. Of course, he was not able to challenge the might of [[Azurlee]] entirely but he was able to prevent a large chunk of the land from sinking completely into the waves, forming [[Apsalon Island]]. 

**Worship:** Under the religious rule of Apsalon war is forbidden among the inhabitants of the remaining islands. The consequences for violating this edict are as of yet unknown.
