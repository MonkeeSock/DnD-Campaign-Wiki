Bio: A True Elf servant of Val, Raven Who Steals the Sun is known for having the ability to take the form of a raven and is known to be in this form more than his elven form.  Raven Who Steals the Sun is best known for a story where he steals the sun from Tsarn. When Tsarn chases him he dips below the horizon to hide it but is still found. Next, he flies as high as he can but Tsarn is able to chase him still so he drops the sun. When the light hit the ground it split into the sun, moon and stars. 

Worship: Temples dedicated to Val are often dedicated to a True Elf as well. One of the ways to honor Raven Who Steals the Sun is to gather shiny things and small trinkets that bring you joy.
