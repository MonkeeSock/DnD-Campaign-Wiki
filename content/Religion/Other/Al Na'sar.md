Bio: Al Na'sar is the brother of the Dead God [[Val]]. Unlike his brother Al Na'sar was never truly a God, but instead a lesser deity. Not much is recorded of him before [[The War of the Gods]], as he mostly lived in his brother's shadow. When the war began he joined [[Gruumsh]] to kill [[Val]]. Unlike [[Gruumsh]] Al Na'sar wanted to rule the [[Feywild]], not destroy it. Their alliance was broken and Al Na'sar was forced to fight [[Demons]] on one front and [[True Elves]] and their followers on the other. Al Na'sar and his followers were forced out of the [[Feywild]].

After being forced out of the [[Feywild]] Al Na'sar marched on a realm now called the [[Shadowfell]], which was The Land of Death and [[Draenyth]]'s home. After [[Draenyth]] was killed he went on to conquer this realm for his own and it is believed he rules there still.

Worship: Most of Al Na'sar's followers dwell with him in the [[Shadowfell]] and hope to one day complete his goal of conquering the [[Feywild]].
