Bio: One of the True Elves who followed [[Val]] into the Feywild in the early days of the world, they gave up their immortality to assist the people of Illaset against Garsooth. They arrived at the moment of what should have been the final battle and Garsooth’s ultimate victory and reversed what had been a losing battle. Under their leadership the [[elves]] liberated the majority of the continent for a brief time. These victories did not last, however, and after a devastating defeat at Mustil City Love’s Stubborn Rebellion and their forces retreated to Myril Keep where they were ultimately killed by Garsooth in a dramatic battle. Recently, the residual divinity at Myril Keep was awakened to destroy the siege engines of an army attacking Myril Keep. 

Worship: Few still worship Love’s Stubborn Rebellion or know of their sacrifice but the wood elves still sing their name and story in thanks for their service.
