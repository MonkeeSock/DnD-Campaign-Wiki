The Maiden Who Dances on a Star is one of the [[True Elves]]. She dwelled in the [[Feywild]] until an elvish crew ended up in her harbor after a bad storm. While they were there for repairs she bonded with the crew and decided to join them on their voyages.

Eventually she was nearly killed and decided to put the last parts of her divinity and power into three discs which were then inserted into the ship itself. This merged her soul and divinity with the ship and created [[The Maiden]] as it is now.
