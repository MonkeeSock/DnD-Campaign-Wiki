The Moon Cave is the spiritual embodiment of a cave beneath Mustill City in the Middle Kingdom of [[Illaset]]. The cave has a deep, dark pit in the center of it which an eternal spring flows into as a waterfall and glowing crystals and fungus that wax and wane with the cycles of the moon. 

At some point in the city's history someone put a grate over the pit and built an alehouse around the waterfall, now called The Grate Hall. The Grate Hall has become the center of thriving community which lives in the depths of caves and warrens below Mustill City, sometimes called Visco City.
