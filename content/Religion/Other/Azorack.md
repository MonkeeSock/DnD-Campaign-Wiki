Azorack is a fiendish entity worshipped by a cult based in [[Almarra Forest]]. Their current operations are focused on [[Minarra]]. His cultists have referred to him as the "Lord of Pain" and seem to seek pain as an act of worship and devotion. 

Azorack's followers seem to believe he is demonic, but based on [[Lucien]]'s knowledge this seems unlikely. None of the [[Demon Lords]] are called Azorack and its unlikely any ordinary [[Demons]] could organize such a cult. It is more likely that Azorack is one of many [[Devils]] seeking to rise to prominence. There is the possibility Azorack is an aspect of the [[Yugoloth]] but little information exists about these aspects.
