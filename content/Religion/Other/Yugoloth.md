[[Devils]] seek to dominate and rule while [[Demons]] seek to destroy everything that ever was or will be. [[Asmodeus]] hates [[Demons]] because if they succeed there will be nothing left for him to rule, for him to control. And he seeks to rule because he knows that he knows best. [[Gruumsh]] seeks to destroy because his own suffering at the hands of [[Val]] and [[Entropy]] destroyed his mind. He can see no beauty in the world, and to him destruction is merciful. Suffering is only inevitable when there is something. 

Both [[Demons]] and [[Devils]] commit acts of evil and terror as the means to an end. They may get pleasure out of being evil, but it is not their fundamental purpose.

The Yugoloth is something different. 

Not much is known about the Yugoloth. It does not seek control or destruction, it only seeks evil. The Yugoloth is evil for evil's sake. It seeks pain and suffering and will use whatever tools are necessary for that end. It is generally believed that the Yugoloth suppresses knowledge about itself so that it may achieve its designs better. 

The Yugoloth is a skilled shapeshifter. It is believed to be a single entity but it is known to split itself into aspects, creating what seems like many Yugoloths. Its origins are unknown and its existence is shrouded is mystery. There is only one thing which is certain about it: the Yugoloth is.
