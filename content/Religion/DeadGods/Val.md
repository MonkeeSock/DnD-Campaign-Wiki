Bio: Val is the God of chaotic nature and the creator of the [[Elves]]. He was killed during the war of the Gods but is often still worshiped by elves. Before he died he took 100 of his closest followers into the fey-wild and made them immortal, making them [[True Elves]].Â 

Worship: Followers of Val will build shrines to the dead God in the woods and forests and allow them to be overgrown and reclaimed by nature.
