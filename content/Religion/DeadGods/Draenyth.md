Draenyth was the God of death but was exiled during [[The War of the Gods]]. He was long thought dead but was eventually discovered in a demi-plane by [[The Bandit Bashers]]. The demi-plane consisted of a only a small island and a lonely lighthouse. During [[The War of the Gods]] he was the natural enemy of [[Beelzebub]].

Not knowing his true identity, the party helped Draenyth escape the demi-plane after capturing a damaged githyanki ship which happened to crash land in the plane. Earlier in their adventures the party had found a stone in an Eternal Observatory built by [[The Old Empire]]. The stone contained some of the exiled God's power and essence. Draenyth stole the stone and attempted to steal the stone and abandon the party. They captured him again, but decided to release him afterwards.

After leaving [[The Bandit Bashers]] Draenyth travelled to [[Wynion]] where he encountered members of [[The Twilight Tavern]] who had also collected a Stone of Draenyth. The party gave the stone to Draenyth and he continued on his way.

Draenyth made his way to [[Daeda]] where he found a death cultist named Dunak of Dust who had collected another Stone of Draenyth on his own. Draenyth collected this stone as well.

In the thirty years since his release Draenyth has steadily built his following. Members of his order, particularly those who follow the High Priest and King [[Illidan]], have begin to build libraries and collect knowledge in their temples. This has angered members of [[Lifttan]]'s order who feel as though Draenyth and his followers may be seeking to usurp their own God and make Draenyth a Prime Deity. (See [[Prime Deities]])
