Bio: Verdunn was a God of water and storms, but was killed during [[The War of the Gods]] by [[Azurlee]]. It is believed that his body lies at the bottom of Llyn Lake in [[Wynion]] which is believed to have infinite depth. Sometimes sailors can see a titanic hand reaching up from the depths of the lake as they sail above it.Â For all of recorded history sailing has been challenging for means beyond phyiscal, and mnay attribute this to the disbalance caused by Verdunn's death. 

Worship: Worship of Verdunn is rare in the current age, but he is sometimes worshiped by sailors. They will often pray to him for calm weather and smooth sailing.
