While the exact nature of the divine is a matter of intense theological debate, it is generally accepted that many divine beings are the embodied will of various natural phenomenon. Therefore, it is not truly possible to kill a deity unless the very process they embody ceases as well. That being said, the embodiment that is a deity can be destroyed rendering its will inert.
