Lilith is the one of the [[Archdevils]] of [[Hell]] and is often associated with lust, envy and forbidden knowledge. She is the wife of [[Asmodeus]] and considered to be the queen of [[Hell]]. Lilith appears as a woman of perfect beauty. They know this beauty is unobtainable, but still must have it. Those who see her believe that she knows every secret and has all of the answers, and she may give them if they please her enough.

Lilith is often considered the source of nightmares and can invade the world of dreams. This is one of her preferred ways of corrupting mortal souls. Lilith is a great sorceress and tempts mortals with forbidden knowledge. Members of [[Lifttan]]'s order often oppose her.
