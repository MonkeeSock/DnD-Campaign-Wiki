Once, Asmodeus was an archangel who served a greater Deity. When the [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] began Asmodeus felt the Gods were not taking enough action against the threat the [[Gruumsh]] and his demonic hordes posed. Asmodeus broke the orders of his master and was cast from the Heavens into Hell where he became the first true devil. 

Asmodeus began to corrupt mortal souls in order to build his legions and strengthen himself. First, he struck out against Gruumsh and his [[Demon Hordes]] but eventually he cast his ire towards the heavens as well. His [[devils]] wreaked havoc among the Gods and Asmodeus even slew his former master.
