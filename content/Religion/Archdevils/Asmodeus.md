Once, Asmodeus was an archangel who served a greater Deity. When the [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] began Asmodeus felt the Gods were not taking enough action against the threat the [[Gruumsh]] and his demonic hordes posed. Asmodeus broke the orders of his master and was cast from the Heavens into [[Hell]] where he became the first true devil, king of [[Archdevils]]

Asmodeus began to corrupt mortal souls in order to build his legions and strengthen himself. First, he struck out against Gruumsh and his [[Demon Hordes]] but eventually he cast his ire towards the heavens as well. His [[Devils]] wreaked havoc among the Gods and Asmodeus even slew his former master. 

Asmodeus is often associated with luck and twisted sense of fate. Gambling dens sometimes take on Asmodeus as their patron and gambler's down on their luck will sometimes pray to the king of demons, forgetting that the house always wins.

He is married to archdevil [[Lilith]].
