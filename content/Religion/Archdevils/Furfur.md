 Furfur is one of the [[Archdevils]] of [[Hell]] and is the only devil truly capable of lying. While he is not considered the most powerful of devils, in some ways this makes him the most dangerous. It is possible to compel Furfur to tell the truth through powerful magical rituals.

Furfur is a great storyteller and can inspire those who seek glory, fame and influence, for a price. Many bards  and minstrels worship [[Teitheo]] but those who feel their talent is under appreciated by the masses often turn to Furfur and his servants instead. In some instances, influential politicians have been caught in scandalous worship of the devil to inspire their own oration.
