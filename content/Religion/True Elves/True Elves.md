 The first 100 [[Elves]] created by [[Val]] were granted immortality in the early days of the world. During [[The War of the Gods]], when [[The Material Plane]] and the [[Feywild]] were separated the True Elves came with [[Val]] to the [[Feywild]]. The True Elves brought many other [[Elves]] with them, but many more remained on [[The Material Plane]]. 

After [[Val]] was killed the True Elves continued to live in the [[Feywild]]. They have each created their own domains within the Fey-wild, ruling over fey courts made primarily of Eladrin. 

The following is a list of some True Elves:
	[[Crow Whose Every Feather is a Thousand Stories]]
	[[Lance which Pierces the Veil]]
	[[Love's Stubborn Rebellion]]
	[[Raven Who Steals the Sun]]
