Bio: As the Goddess of luck and fortune she is one of the most directly involved [[Prime Deities]] with mortal affairs of [[The Material Plane]]. She is also the goddess of hopes and ambitions. She is also associated with dreams, particularly prophetic ones. It is not  well understood where these prophecies come from but because of them she also has connections to the concept of fate or destiny, like [[Weitheo]].

Worship: Believing that a convincing argument can make Lady Luck act in your favor, her followers highly value an individual's charisma. They also know that the Goddess does not suffer fools who would trust in luck more than itâ€™s worth, meaning they also value wisdom.
