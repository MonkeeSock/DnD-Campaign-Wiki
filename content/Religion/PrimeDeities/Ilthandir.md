Domains: Life, peace

Symbol: A waxing crescent, a full moon and a waning crescent in a row. 

Bio: The God of redemption and renewal, Ilthandir is the God of the moon and self knowledge. He is also the God of healing. In many way he is Tsarn’s reflection. Where Tsarn represents understanding of others, Ilthandir represents understanding of the self. There is debate as to whether the two are actually separate entities.  Ilthandir is also associated with sleep and rules the world of dreams with Elslyn.

Worship: With their connection to the moon members of Ilthandir’s order often perform their rites and rituals under the light of the moon.
