Domains: Life, peace

Symbol: A waxing crescent, a full moon and a waning crescent in a row. 

Bio: The God of redemption and renewal, Ilthandir is the God of the moon and self knowledge. He is also the God of healing. In many way he is [[Tsarn]]’s reflection. Where Tsarn represents understanding of others, Ilthandir represents understanding of the self. Some have argued they are even both just diffrent aspects of the same entity. Ilthandir is also associated with sleep and rules the world of dreams with [[Elslyn]].

Worship: With their connection to the moon members of Ilthandir’s order often perform their rites and rituals under the light of the moon.
