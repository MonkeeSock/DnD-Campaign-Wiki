Bio: At the beginning of the Dragon Wars news of Glamthring’s death spread quickly. Caemaruse was ambushed by Calissmo and a band of mortals and slain. Never the most intelligent of the dragons Caemaruse has always been the  hardiest. Trapped in a valley with his wings destroyed it still took days for the great wyrm to be killed. He was killed again by the Bandit Bashers after a short reincarnation. Acclimated to cold weather, Caemaruse has thick fur rather than scales.

Worship: Caemaruse’s followers prize constitution. The dragon’s followers seek to endure an ever changing world until the time is ripe for his return.
