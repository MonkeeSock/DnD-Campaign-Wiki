Bio: At the beginning of [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]] news of [[Glamthring|/Dragon/Glamthring]]’s death spread quickly. Caemaruse was ambushed by [[Calissmo|/Dragon/Calissmo]] and a band of mortals and slain. Never the most intelligent of the [[Dragons]], Caemaruse has always been the  hardiest. Trapped in a valley with his wings destroyed it still took days for the great wyrm to be killed. He was killed again by [[The Bandit Bashers|The Bandit Bashers]] after a short reincarnation. Acclimated to cold weather, Caemaruse has thick fur rather than scales.

Worship: Caemaruse’s followers prize constitution. The dragon’s followers seek to endure an ever changing world until the time is ripe for his return.
