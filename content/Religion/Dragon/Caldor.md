Bio: Insectile in nature, the black dragon Caldor is the cruelest of the [[Dragons]]. Caldor was not killed in [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]] but instead went into a deep slumber in a thick swamp in [[Vokmir]]. When the dragons finally returned Caldor conquered a region once known as [[Vokmir]] where many [[Dragonborn]] dwell. While the dragon has a solid hold over this region, he was prevented from expanding his empire by the kingdom of [[Admar]]. 

Worship: Those devoted to Caldor primarily dwell in his new kingdom, [[Caldoria]]. They ply their dragon God with gold and treasure and new victims to amuse himself with.
