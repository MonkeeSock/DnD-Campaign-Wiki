Bio: Insectile in nature, the black dragon Caldor is the cruelest of the dragons. Caldor was no killed in the War of the Dragons but instead went into a deep slumber in a thick swamp in the Clan-holds Region. When the dragons finally returned Caldor conquered a region once known as the Clan-holds where many dragonborn dwell. While the dragon has a solid hold over this region, he was prevented from expanding his empire by the kingdom of Admar. 

Worship: Those devoted to Caldor primarily dwell in his new kingdom, Caldoria. They ply their dragon God with gold and treasure and new victims to amuse himself with.
