Bio: Glamthring is the golden dragon and the most powerful of the metallic [[Dragons]]. [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]] began when Glamthring was slain by the Red Dragon [[Solva|/Dragon/Solva]]. Linked with Elslyn the dragon embodies luck and fortune. He had golden scales at a catfish like appearance. He was designated as the original leader of the metallic dragons, sent to guide mortals to their fate and boost their fortune. Grand and aloof, Glamthring chose rarely to become directly involved with mortal entanglements, seeking to see the grand scheme of things, rather than details.Â 

Worship: Glamthring represents many things which are often contradictory. Fate and fortune are both fickle and absolute at the same time. Despite often seeming dethatched and random followers of Glamthring believe that both the dragon and fate are ultimately good. Glamthring also represents truth and goodness which are revealed in the light of gold and fire.
