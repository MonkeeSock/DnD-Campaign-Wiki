 Domains: Tempest

Symbol: A storm cloud

Bio: Garsooth is the Blue Dragon. His appearance is eel-like. Like [[Elminster|/Dragon/Elminster]], Garsooth was not killed during [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]] and remained awake. He prepared for the return of the dragons as Elminster did. The two often undid the others preparations through indirect conflict. Eventually Garsooth conquered the southern continent known as Illaset. 

Centuries later Garsooth launched an assault on the region known as Hen Ymorda. [[The Bandit Bashers|/The Bandit Bashers]] stopped him. Ambrose Jones described the battle which ensued, "then he got spanked by an Applebee's employee and its founder, a death God zealot, the Legendary BBL and a demigod using lightning that worked for some reason."

Worship:  Garsooth and his followers value strength above all else. Wyverns are viewed as sacred creatures in the religion and are often raised by his followers. As an act of devotion Garsooth’s followers will battle wyverns in arena style combat. Eels are another creature revered by Garsooth’s followers and are eaten during sacred rituals.
