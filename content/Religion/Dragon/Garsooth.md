Symbol: A storm cloud

Bio: Garsooth is the Blue Dragon. His appearance is eel-like. Like Elminster, Garsooth was not killed during the dragon wars and remained awake. He prepared for the return of the dragons as Elminster did. The two often undid the others preparations through indirect conflict. Eventually Garsooth conquered the southern continent known as Illaset. 

Worship:  Garsooth and his followers value strength above all else. Wyverns are viewed as sacred creatures in the religion and are often raised by his followers. As an act of devotion Garsooth’s followers will battle wyverns in arena style combat. Eels are another creature revered by Garsooth’s followers and are eaten during sacred rituals.
