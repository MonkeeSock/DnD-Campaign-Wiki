Domains: War, conquest

Symbol: Flames above an image of the world

Bio: Chief of the chromatic [[dragons]], Solva is the greatest dragon in terms of raw power, rivaled only by [[Glamthring|/Dragon/Glamthring]]. [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]] began when Solva slew Glamthring. Upon his awakening Solva was challenged by heroes of [[The Twilight Tavern]] who banished the dragon to the astral plane. Solva's tail and wing were sliced by the portal as it closed and where they landed on the ground became the site of a massive volcano called the Red Mountain.Â 

Worship: Worshippers of Solva value strength and charisma. They seek to build strong, totalitarian empires to subjugate all others. The most devout now search for ways to bring their lord back from the astral plane.
