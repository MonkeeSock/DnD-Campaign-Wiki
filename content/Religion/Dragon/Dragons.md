The dragons were brought to and tied to [[The Material Plane|/Material Plane/The MaterialPlane]] after [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] to shepherd the people there and rebuild the world after the destruction which was wrought by the War of the Gods. 

There are five chromatic dragons and five metallic dragons. In general the metallic dragons are good while chromatic dragons are evil. 

While it is possible to destroy the physical body of a Dragon they will eventually reform somewhere on [[The Material Plane]] and their souls can not be destroyed. Most of the dragons were either killed or forced into a long slumber during [[The Dragon Wars|/The Dragon Wars]]
