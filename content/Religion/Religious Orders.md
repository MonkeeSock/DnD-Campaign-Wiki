title: Religious Orders

Currently there are eight [[Prime Deities|/content/Religion/Prime DeIties]] which are generally worshiped by all across the Material Plane, but it wasn't always so. The current order was established after the War of the Gods by treaties which bind the Prime Deities and the [[Devils|/content/Religion/Archdevils/Devils]]  of hell to certain codes of behavior. While the [[Demon Hordes|/content/religion/DemonLords/Demon Hordes]] are partially bound by this treaty it is in their nature to ignore such restriction and sow chaos where ever they can. 

In addition to the Prime Deities there are countless other entities who are worshipped as well. Many of these are the spirit or embodiment of a local feature such as a mountain, cave or city. Others are a different kind of entity such as the fey True Elves. Examples of commonly worshipped True Elves are [[Love's Stubborn Rebellion|/content/Religion/Other/Love's Stubborn Rebellion]] and [[Raven Who Steals the Sun|/content/Religion/Other/Raven Who Steals the Sun]]. Local spirits which embody a particular landmark or geographical feature are commonly worshipped as well, like the [[Moon Cave]] in [[Illaset]].

The [[Dragons|/content/Religion/Dragon/Dragons]] of the Material Plane are also semi-divine and are primarily worshipped by their respective dragonborn species. Other species are often swayed into joining Dragon Cults, most notably in Illaset where the majority of the population worships the Blue Dragon [[Garsooth|/content/Religion/Dragon/Garsooth]], out of fear of punishment and persecution.
