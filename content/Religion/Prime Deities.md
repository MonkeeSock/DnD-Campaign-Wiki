There are eight Prime Deities worshipped on the Material Plane. These are the survivors of [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]], a series of calamitous battles that took place across the Material Plane. Many other Gods were killed (see [[Dead Gods|/DeadGods/Dead Gods]]), exiled and banished during this period. Some became leaders of Demon Hordes and other Archdevils. In general, the Prime Deities remain uninvolved in the affairs of the Material Plane preferring to enact change via indirect means. This is due to the fact that they are neither omnipotent nor omniscient and certain binding that were placed on them after the War of the Gods.
