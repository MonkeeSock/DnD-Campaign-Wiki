Bio: Azurlee one of the [[Demon Lords]] who rules a deep, watery part of [[The Abyss]]. Some believe she is the mother of all storms. She rules over the deep, dark waters and seeks to bring souls into her domain by drowning them. Souls claimed by Azurlee and dragged to the very depths of her domain are utterly annihilated. She was the enemy of [[Verdunn]] and killed him during [[The War of the Gods]]. 

Worship: Azurlee is most commonly worshipped by sailors out of fear. They sometimes seek to appease her to prevent her from drowning them at sea. Others, such as Adrius and [[T. J. Palmer]], take a defiant attitude towards her.
