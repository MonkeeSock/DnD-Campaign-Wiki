Before he was the Lord of all Demons Gruumsh was a God. In the times before [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] there were many, many Gods with many more petty rivalries and jealousies. In those days the Gods took very active roles in the shaping of the Material Plane and often appeared as powerful avatars to live among the mortal souls they had created.

When Gruumsh went to create the orcs he found all the Material Plane had been claimed. [[Val|/DeadGods/Val]] had claimed the forests for his elves, [[Teitheo|/PrimeDeities/Teitheo]] and Dumathoin the mountains for the dwarves and still more had been claimed by Gods and species now long since forgotten to time. 

Seeking compromise, Gruumsh went to the other Gods and asked if they would not share their homes with his orcs. The other Gods all turned him down and told Gruumsh to seek out Val, who had once promised to share the forests with all the creatures of the Material Plane. When Gruumsh spoke to him, however, capricious Val had changed his mind and denied the request. 

Enraged, Gruumsh threw 1,000 spears into the earth and created 1,000 caves where he created his orcs and gave them space to live. As he created the orcs he fashioned them to be parasitic, requiring elves or other species as a host to make their young. The other species would never be at peace with orcs and orcs would never be at peace them. 

Val took Gruumsh's actions as an insult and the two fought, leading armies of elves and orcs. Eventually, Val cut out Gruumsh's eye and the God retreated into the Astral Sea. As he wandered the Astral Sea Gruumsh stumbled upon a void caused by Entropy, which twisted his mind and began The War of the Gods.
