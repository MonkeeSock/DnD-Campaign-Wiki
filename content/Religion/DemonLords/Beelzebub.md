Beelzebub is a Demon Lord who is most often depicted as a massive fly. He is the father of lies, putrid decay and undeath. 

Beezelbub was one of the first demons to spring from [[The Abyss]] and took an active role in [[The War of the Gods]]. In particular he was an enemy of [[Draenyth]] and sought to unseat the god and claim death entirely as his own. In many ways he was successful. Where [[Draenyth]] represents death which begets new life Beelzebub is death which only begets new death.
