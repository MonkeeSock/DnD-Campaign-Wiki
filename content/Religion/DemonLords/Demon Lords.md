 Demon Lords are ethe powerful leaders of [[Demons]] and reside in [[The Abyss]]. [[Gruumsh]] became the first Demon Lord after his mind was twisted by [[Entropy]]. The Demon Lords are bent on chaos and destruction and generally seek to accelerate [[Entropy]] and the inevitable annihilation of all things, however, this is not always the case. 

Unlike [[Devils]], Demons rarely seek to corrupt mortals, instead preferring to simply annihilate them. They will, however, sometimes grant power to a mortal who seems likely to create chaos and destruction on [[The Material Plane]].
