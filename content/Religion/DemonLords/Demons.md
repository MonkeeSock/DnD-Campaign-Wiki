 Although there was evil, there were no true Demons until [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] had begun. The first Demons came out of [[The Abyss]] which was torn open by [[Gruumsh|/DemonLords/Gruumsh]] after his encounter with [[Entropy]] in the Astral Sea. Gruumsh led the hordes from [[The Abyss]] against the rest of the world and other [[Demon Lords]] soon joined him, either spawining from [[The Abyss]] itself or after being twisted by [[Entropy]] like Gruumsh before them.
