 Although there was evil, there were no true Demons until [[The War of the Gods|/Calamities/The War of the Gods]] had begun. The first Demons came out of the Abyss which was torn open by [[Gruumsh|/DemonLords/Gruumsh]] after his encounter with [[Entropy]] in the Astral Sea. Gruumsh led the hordes from the Abyss against the rest of the world and other Demon Lords soon joined him, either spawining from the Abyss itself or after being twisted by [[Entropy]] like Gruumsh before them.
