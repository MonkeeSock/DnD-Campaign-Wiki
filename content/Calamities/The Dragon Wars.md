The Dragon Wars were the second major calamity in the history of the world. After [[The War of the Gods|/The War of the Gods]] the [[Dragons|/Dragons]] were brought to [[The Material Plane|/The Material Plane]] to help the sapient species rebuild. The metallic dragons were sent by the [[Prime Deities|/Prime Deities]] to be a force of positive change while the Archdevils sent the chromatic dragons to sow evil and corrupt mortal souls. 

The dragons each brought with them their respective dragonborn to help rebuild the fallen civilizations and repopulate the ruined Material Plane.

Each of the dragons built their own domains in various locations across the Material Plane and they often came into minor conflicts with each other as they expanded, but both chromatic and metallic dragons avoided a direct confrontation, knowing that such a conflict would destroy what they had built.

Eventually, this changed when [[Glamthring|/Glamthring]] attacked [[Solva|/Solva]]. Solva managed to kill Glamthring and the Dragon Wars began. [[Salvonis|/Salvonis]] flew into a rage and attacked Solva after news of Glamthring's death had reached him and was swiftly beaten. With two of the metallic dragons already destroyed the chromatic dragons were set for dominance over the Material Plane but what should have been an easy victory became a long and protracted war. The leadership of [[Talthomis|/Talthomis]], the intelligence of [[Elminster|/Elminster]] and the guile of [[Calissmo|/Calissmo]] formed a powerful combination. 

The draconic empires entered pitched battles. The metallic dragons slew [[Caemaruse|/Caemaruse]] early on and Elminster defeated [[Raemose|/Raemose]] individually, baiting his arrogance. The great draconic civilizations fell into ruin as battle after battle decimated their populations and destroyed their metropolises. 

Everything was set to culminate in one massive battle on [[Cyn-Tollir|/Cyn-Tollir]] in the region now called [[Vokmir]]. There the remaining draconic armies gathered, the metallic dragonborn led by Elminster and Calissmo and the chromatic by Caldor and Garsooth. Talthomis split from this group to delay Solva and his army from joining the battle. 

Talthomis was eventually slain but Solva and his army were delayed in Daeda. Before the other battle could be finished, however, the dragons seemingly all disappeared. It was said some went into slumber, while others simply left.

The dragonborn were suddenly leaderless but after centuries of conflict they did the only thing the remembered to do and continued to fight. The armies settled in the area around the battle field, forming clans. It wasn't long before no side could continue a full scale war and truces were made but these were often broken as one clan would seek to gain advantage over another. Things continued on this way for thousands of years as the dragonborn became entrenched in the region and blood feuds continued to fuel their war. While the largescale destruction the dragons had wrought as over, The Dragon Wars never truly ended as the dragonborn continued to fight one another.
