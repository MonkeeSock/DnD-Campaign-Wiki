 Over a millennium and a half ago [[The Old Empire]] collapsed, leading to political instability and civil unrest throughout [[Cyn-Tollir]]. [[Vokmir]], which had found and stability for centuries under imperial rule, fell back into tribal fighting; [[Wynion]] became a region of feuding city states; [[Sulwaf]] fell into many decaying backwater kingdoms; only three stable kingdoms survived in [[Daeda]] while the rest of its people turned to nomadic life styles and [[Hen Ymorda]] itself fell into numerous petty, warring kingdoms. 

As The Empire collapsed many of its libraries and much of its arcane knowledge was destroyed as rebellions and wars engulfed the continent. [[The Old Empire]] did not collapse quickly or easily, instead it was  long, gasping death which brought down the rest of the continent with it. 

There are several reasons The Empire collapsed. While the regions outside of [[Hen Ymorda]] were conquered and ruled under strict imperial law, the ancient kingdoms which inhabited the [[Hen Ymorda]] region before the empire were not under such strict rulership. Many retained high levels of autonomy and their own royal lines, leading to internal strife and frequent civil war as various royal families fought for control of the empire itself. 

Once the empire expanded across the vast majority of the continent it began to run out of new lands to conquer, leading to economic collapse. The people conquered by the empire also frequently resisted imperial rule, leading to constant rebellions and uprising which drained the army's resources. 

Finally, there was an ancient curse placed in the empire during its first war against the elves. Many believe this curse was ultimately behind the empire's collapse.
