The War of the Gods was the first major calamity in history and the one of the greatest scale. The war completely changed the surface of all of the planes, and may have changed the very shape of the world itself. It was a period of utter chaos and it resulted in the destruction of numerous once great civilizations. Such levels of technology, understanding and sophistication have never been seen since. 

The war began when [[Gruumsh|/DemonLords/Gruumsh]] wandered into the Astral Plane after Val had cut out his eye. Furious and vengeful, he searched the Astral Sea for allies he could use against Val, until he stumbled upon [[Entropy]]. Gruumsh gazed into the Void of [[Entropy]] and would have been destroyed if he had still had both eyes, but his impaired vision protected him from total annihilation. Grrumsh returned to the Material Plane and tore open the Abyss, releasing the first demons into the world. 

The opening of the Abyss and the encounter with [[Entropy]] changed the order of all things. The planes of evil, good, chaos and order all aligned themselves separately from [[The Material Plane]], warping the shape of all things. Gods, angels and other deities found unexpected changes in themselves as their own natures were warped with the bending of the world. 

Other Demon Lords emerged after Gruumsh, many warped by the Abyss as [[Entropy]] had warped him. Gruumsh got the revenge he sought and slew [[Val]], but kept on in order to destroy reality itself. [[Asmodeus|/Archdevils/Asmodeus]] the Archangel fell from grace and became the Archdevil of Hell. As the Gods fought mountains rose and oceans sank, nearly all sapient life on the Material Plane was extinguished. [[Dwarves]] endured as stone does and [[Elves]] bent with changes as trees do in wind. For a time, [[Gnomes]] were utterly annihilated. Many others were brought to the brink and more still destroyed, along with the Gods who had made them. 

Eventually, the forces of Good and Order aligned. The [[Prime Deities|/content/Prime Deities]] worked in harmony with each other and turned the tide against both the [[Demon Hordes|/DemonLords/Demon Hordes]] and Devil legions. The Prime Deities made a treaty with Asmodeus, ruler of Hell. While the details of this treaty are largely unknown to mortals, it is generally known that it limits the ability of the Prime Deities to directly interfere with the Material Plane and in exchange Asmodeus and his Devilish Legions keep the Demon Hordes at bay. 

At the end of the war the metallic [[Dragons|/Dragon/Dragons]] were summoned by the Prime Deities and the chromatic by the [[content/Religion/Archdevils/Archdevils|Archdevils]] and Demon Lords to influence the surviving peoples of the Material Plane and help them build, or in some cases tear down, the new world order.
