The Secret History of the Dragon Wars is treatise written by an unknown Elvish scholar on [[Illaset]]. The treatise alleges that the Dragon Wars never really ended, instead devolving into a series of proxy wars primarily between [[Elminster]] and [[Garsooth]]. These wars spanned [[The Material Plane]] but were concentrated on [[Illaset]]. Ultimately, [[Garsooth]] conquered the continent but [[Elminster]] was able to delay his complete domination by centuries while maintaining the spell which kept the other [[Dragons]] in a slumber.
