For most species in the various planes their language is a gift from the Gods, primarily [[Teitheo]]. Because of this, most languages have remained fairly unchanged through the eons. [[Elves]] on [[Illaset]] can still communicate with those on [[Cyn-Tollir]], despite having little to no contact for thousands of years. Each species also has a semi-ingrained, supernatural knowledge of their respective language. 

The exceptions to this rule are Common and the various languages of [[Humans]]. 

Common is a divinely gifted language it is a more flexible language the others. It has been able to change and adapt more over the many years, especially with the introduction of human languages into the world. 

It is believed that the human language group was not divinely gifted but instead organically developed on its own. In addition, humans do not have the same supernatural connection to their own languages as the other species do. Because of this, many human languages have died or been superseded by Common.
